Before diving into the modeling process, itâ€™s important to recognize that every model is a handcrafted product. This guide is not a recipe, but a foundationâ€”a structured set of good practices to support your work and help you build models that are robust, interpretable, and valuable.

Throughout each step, validate your work incrementally. If you canâ€™t validate an entire pipeline immediately, validate small samples to ensure youâ€™re heading in the right direction.

This material was developed primarily with supervised models in a banking context in mind, but it also includes insights that are applicable to unsupervised learning and general modeling strategy.

ðŸ“Œ Regardless of the algorithm chosen, the greatest value in a modeling project comes from decisions made in the early stages:

Defining a target variable that accurately reflects the business problem

Selecting an eligible population that truly represents the operational context

Creating relevant, informative features that capture the underlying patterns

Selecting the most appropriate subset of features for the model

Defining a sampling window aligned with business cycles and data reality

While cutting-edge algorithms can provide marginal performance gains, they are rarely the defining factor in a successful modeling project. A well-defined problem, solid data, and thoughtful feature engineering will always be the real drivers of impact.
