Before starting any modeling effort, it‚Äôs crucial to deeply understand the business problem and the true need behind it. Many data science projects fail not because of poor modeling, but because the problem was poorly framed from the outset.

Not every challenge requires a complex machine learning solution‚Äîoften, a simple rule-based approach or heuristic can deliver value faster and with less overhead. In some cases, a lightweight baseline model may be the best starting point. On the other hand, problems involving long-term predictions, personalization, or dynamic systems may benefit from more sophisticated models with greater complexity and precision.

To guide this understanding, we break the process into three key steps:

## üîç Discovery & Insight

This phase focuses on aligning with stakeholders to clearly define the business objective and ensure the team is solving the right problem. It‚Äôs not just about understanding what the stakeholder wants, but uncovering why they want it (e.g., reduce churn, predict default, optimize acquisition).

Start by partnering with the business area to define:

- **The objective:** What is our goal? What decision are we trying to support, automate, or improve? What‚Äôs the limitation of the current process or model? What pain point are we addressing?
    
        ‚û§ Tip: Analyze historical data and business processes to identify 
           bottlenecks and root causes.

- **The expected impact:** How will this solution create value? Examples include reducing financial risk, increasing revenue, or improving operational efficiency. What actions or decisions will be driven by the model‚Äôs output?

- **Constraints and requirements:** Are there deadlines, regulatory rules (e.g., fairness, explainability), technical restrictions, or data access issues?

Because this step sets the foundation for the entire project, it's critical to ensure nothing important is overlooked. That includes:

- **Clarifying success metrics:** both business KPIs (e.g., approval rate, NPS, default rate) and technical performance metrics (e.g., AUC, precision, recall)

- **Understanding the decision context:** who will use the model, how often, and how the output will be interpreted and acted upon

- **Scoping the solution space:** determine whether a business rule, statistical model, or machine learning solution is most appropriate given the complexity, timeline, and available data

        üìå Best Practice: If available, review existing dashboards, reports,
            previous models, or experiment results to understand what‚Äôs already
            been tried and what gaps remain.

## üéØ Target Definition

### Classification

#### Ever

#### Over

### Regression

## üí° Solution Definition

Identify how the model will be used and what impact it should have.

## ‚ú® Optional Enhancements (Only If You Want to Expand Further)

### Stakeholder Map
List who is involved and who will use the model output (analysts, business teams, product, legal). This helps align communication and expectations.

### Decision Journey Mapping
Show where in the process the model will impact decisions (e.g., credit approval, campaign selection). This clarifies integration points.

### Risk/Feasibility Assessment
Include a short check for data availability, regulatory limits (e.g., fair lending laws), or black-box explainability concerns.

### Baseline/Benchmark Expectations
What existing rule or model exists? What lift is expected? This sets realistic expectations.
