Receivables assignment (also known as assignment of receivables) is a legal transaction in which a person or institution holding the right to receive a payment transfers that right to a third party. The purpose of this transfer is typically to generate profit, either by selling the receivable at a discount or by using it as an investment opportunity.

This arrangement allows the original creditor (assignor) to receive funds upfront, while the assignee takes on the right to collect the future payment from the debtor.
