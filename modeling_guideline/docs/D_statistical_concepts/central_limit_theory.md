The Central Limit THeorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes approximately normal, regardless of the population's original distribution, as the sample size becomes large enough.

- Works even if the original data is not normally distributed
- Sample size should be sufficiently large (n>30)
- The mean of the sample means $\approx$ population mean
