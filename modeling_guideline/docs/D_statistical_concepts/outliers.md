Outliers are data points significantly different from most other data points in a dataset.


We can detect outliers using some methods:

IQR Method:

- Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
- Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
Any value outide this range is an outlier

Standard Deviation (for normal distribution):

Data points beyond +-2sigma or +- 3sigma from the mean are often considered outliers
