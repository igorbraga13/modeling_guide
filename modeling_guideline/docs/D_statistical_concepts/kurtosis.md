Kurtosis measures the 'tailedness' or heaviness of the tails of the distribution compared to a normal distribution

## Leptokurtic (High Kurtosis)
Heavy tails, sharp peak
Ex: A distribuition with a lot of outliers
## Platykortic (Low Kurtosis)
Light tails, flatter peak
Ex: A flat, spread-out distribution

## Mesokurt (Normal Kurtosis)
Similar to normal distribution
