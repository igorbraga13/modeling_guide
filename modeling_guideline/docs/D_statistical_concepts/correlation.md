Measures how strongly two variable move together

- Positive Correlation: Both variables move in the same disrection
- Negative Correlation: Variable move in opposite
- No Correlation: No clear relationship between variables

## Correlation matriz?

## Kendall
Is a non-parametric test that measures the strength of dependence between two variables

$$ \tau = a $$

## Pearson
Both variable should be normally distributed and need assumptions like linearity (assumes a straight line relationship between each of the two variables) and [homoscedasticity](homoscedasticity.md) (data is equally distributed about the regression line)

## Spearman
Spearman rank correlation is a non-parametric test that measures the degree of association between two variables.
